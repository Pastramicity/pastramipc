Hi! You can call me Pastra, Pastrami, Pastramicity, or you can just call me Chase. I run a small gig where I build the computer you need. 

You can reach me at (pastramipc@gmail.com)[pastramipc@gmail.com]

- Let me know what you need and we can set up an appointment on zoom, over the phone, or over email.
- Once we know what you need, I'll give you a quote.
- You pay and simply wait, and I'll let you know when the computer is done and you can come pick it up.

## Payment

I currently accept Zelle, Venmo, Wire, and crypto. Below are my crypto wallets (I prefer XMR) and wherever else you can find me:

- BTC/Bitcoin: bc1qrktmytvxe9gdc8fcq7ca3jk5v402h8wxz3fvxe
- ETH/Etherum: 0x2E8549f505fEE8538c6797FDc6680f253e289971
- XMR/Monero: 42C9aPw3hpsLZMHv7RbsVo49eW9HCky4LSw3HMio1oPJG7xpJJ8gGTZbjEq4Mnxmhj21qGPi65ZauPaA1XWxc5Ae9GNW8e9

## Some Other Things

- I don't do watercooled PCs. I understand the advantages of watercooling, but the set up process can be dangerous for the hardware if it gets wet, and air-cooling *most of the time* will get the job done.
- I'll handle everything from chords to peripherals to super custom stuff, whatever you need. It can be a raspberry pi for Pete's sake!
